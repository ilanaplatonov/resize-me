# resize-me
I'm using "github.com/nfnt/resize" to resize the image
The server listens on port 8080
try it out http://localhost:8080/thumbnail?url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/7672290-3x2-940x627.jpg&width=940&height=597

the server saves locally all images once at all types of sizes requested by the user
